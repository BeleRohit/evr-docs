# 3.3. Orchestration: The Master Scheduler ‚è∞

## What is Orchestration?

Think of orchestration as the **control tower** of our data pipeline.  
It ensures that **all data processing steps**:

- Run **on time**  
- Execute in the **correct sequence**  
- Handle **dependencies automatically**

Without orchestration, pipelines would be prone to:

- Missed schedules  
- Inconsistent runs  
- Manual intervention for every task

---

## Our Orchestration Tool: **Apache Airflow**

We use **Apache Airflow** to orchestrate all data pipeline tasks.

### **Key Features of Airflow:**

| Feature                     | Description                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **DAGs**                    | Define workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs |
| **Scheduling**              | Run tasks on defined time intervals         |
| **Sensors**                 | Wait for events, like new files in S3       |
| **Retry Logic**             | Automatically retry failed tasks           |
| **Monitoring & Alerts**     | Track DAG runs and receive notifications   |

## Accessing Airflow

- **Web UI:** Airflow provides a **browser-based interface**  
- You can **monitor DAGs**, check logs, pause/resume tasks, and rerun failures  


---

## How It Works: DAGs in Action

A **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) represents the workflow.

Each **DAG**:

- Defines **what tasks to run**  
- Specifies the **order of execution**  
- Determines **when to run them**

---

### **Trigger Methods:**

| Trigger Type        | Example Scenario                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **File Sensor**     | Detects when a new file arrives in **S3**        |
| **Scheduled Run**   | Runs at a set time, e.g., **every day at 3 AM**  |
| **Manual Trigger**  | Run manually from the Airflow UI for testing     |

---

### **Real Example:**

**DAG Name:** `daily_sales_pipeline`

#### Workflow:

1. **File Sensor** waits for a new `sales_data` file in S3  
2. Once detected, the DAG triggers data extraction  
3. Followed by transformation and loading into Snowflake  
4. Data Quality checks run automatically  
5. Pipeline sends success/failure notifications

## Benefits of Using Airflow

| Benefit                | Why It Matters                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Automation**         | No manual effort needed for pipeline runs |
| **Reliability**        | Handles retries and failures gracefully   |
| **Visibility**         | Full view of pipeline status via UI       |
| **Flexibility**        | Can orchestrate across multiple systems   |

---

## Summary

- **Apache Airflow** is our **orchestration engine**  
- It controls **when**, **how**, and **in what order** our data pipelines run  
- It ensures **reliability, automation, and visibility** for our workflows
