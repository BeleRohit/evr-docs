3. Our Data Pipeline: The Big Picture üó∫Ô∏è
Think of our data pipeline as a sophisticated factory that turns raw materials (data) into finished products (insights). Here's a simplified view of how it works:

Our pipeline is divided into several logical stages:

Data Sources: Where our raw data originates.

Ingestion & File Tracker: How we bring data into our cloud and track its arrival.

Orchestration: Our "control tower" that manages and schedules all processing steps.

Data Processing: Where raw data gets cleaned, transformed, and prepared across different layers.

Data Consumers: The people and tools that use the processed data.
